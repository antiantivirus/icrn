Description:

Radio Buena Vida first went on air in October 2020, live from local independent record store, Some Great Reward, who were kind and trusting enough to allow us to use their premises to establish ourselves as a truly safe and welcoming community radio station committed to diversity, inclusivity and equality.

We strive for gender-balanced programming which is representative of all intersections of minority groups, marginalised communities, individuals from working class backgrounds and those who face barriers due to socio-economic circumstances. This is reflected in the events, free-to-attend workshops and community initiatives we organise or collaborate on.

With a radio schedule as diverse as the DJs and presenters, you can expect to hear every genre of music from experimental to disco, punk to ambient, jungle to soul, as well as occasional special guest appearances, interviews and discussions on topics that really matter to you.

In November 2022, we opened the doors to Cafe Buena Vida, where Radio Buena Vida now broadcasts from its location in the bay window, which brought together the original idea of a different kind of radio station within a different kind of community space, serving up quality snacks and drinks to an ever changing soundtrack of shows.

Both the Cafe & radio station are wheelchair accessible. The cafe is ground level with accessible WC facilities while the DJ booth and fully adjustable desk mean no-one is excluded from applying for or presenting a show.

With both entities under one roof, the aim is for Buena Vida to benefit the local community on a personal, collective and geographic level.
