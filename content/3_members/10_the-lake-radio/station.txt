Description:

The Lake Radio is an independent online community radio station out of Copenhagen, Denmark, continually broadcasting an eclectic but deeply curated stream of experimental, alternative, and avant garde music and sound art as well as mixtapes and hosted programs.

We aim to inspire, challenge and surprise the listener by playing music and sounds in every genre, from all over the planet, and from all periods in the history of recorded sound using a simple selection algorithm to create serendipity and extend sonic horizons.

Each year, we also broadcast upwards of a hundred programs, both pre-produced as well as live, that together with curated mixtapes are also distributed as podcasts.

Since the beginning, The Lake has also organized, produced, curated and participated in a wide variety of live events in collaboration with venues, festivals, museums, restaurants and not least artists, and commissioned new radio specific art pieces for the recurring Works For Radio event.

The Lake Radio is maintained and curated by a community of mostly Copenhagen-based artists and radio producers aided by a long list of kind contributors and collaborators. The community is supported by a small, part-time staff, and we are formally organized as a foundation established in 2015.

Our stream is free to listen to and free from commercials, and the music is made available in agreement with rightsholdersâ€™ organizations KODA/NCB, IFPI & Gramex.
