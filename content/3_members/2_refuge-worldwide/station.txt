Description:

Refuge Worldwide is a radio station, educational platform and event series, operating across two locations in Berlin Neukölln.

The project started – simply named Refuge – in 2015 as a fundraising initiative working in solidarity with grassroots and non-profit organisations. Among others, we have worked with a young women’s centre, refugee housing support associations, a music school for marginalised persons, social equity groups, homelessness agencies, and a shelter for women and young persons fleeing domestic violence.

In January 2021 we launched Refuge Worldwide, a radio station to amplify the wide range of music and issues that we care about, broadcasting 24/7 from Weserstraße 166, (12045 Berlin Neukölln). The station’s curation aims to platform a diverse range of voices and give space to those who have not yet had the chance to host a radio show.

We host regular workshops, training programmes and classes in media, creative fields and mental health. These are free to attend as part of our community outreach. Refuge Worldwide is also involved in a number of collaborative projects around the globe with likeminded collectives, radio stations and activists.

In May 2024, we opened a second space at Niemetzstrasse, complete with a fully-equipped music production studio, allowing us to broaden the scope of our educational and event offerings.
