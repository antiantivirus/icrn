Description:

OOO (Out of Office) Radio is a mobile community radio station for experimental sound and curious ears. Based in Helsinki, physically it is a set of tools and internet broadcasting equipment that can be borrowed and used to broadcast remotely from any space (including outdoors by battery power).

OOO Radio has a focus on experimental sound, art, talks, conversations and things that do not have a place on conventional radio. Anyone can borrow the radio equipment for broadcasting their own ideas.

OOO Radio was set up in 2023 by Samantha Lippett and James Prevett, broadcasting live for the whole of November 2023 from Forum Box, Helsinki. Currently, OOO Radio broadcasts sporadically and will be officially relaunched in Spring 2024.
