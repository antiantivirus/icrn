Description:

Resonance FM (est. 1998) is a groundbreaking 24/7 radio station which broadcasts on 104.4 FM to central London, DAB to Greater London, nationally on Radioplayer and live streamed to the rest of the world.

Realised by a dedicated community of volunteer engineers and programme-makers, Resonance offers over 105 creative broadcast series every week featuring local and international artists, makers and experts. Resonance seeks to discover, encourage and support a diverse range of artistic voices through radio – from first-timers to seasoned broadcasters.

Our ambition is to provide a broadcast platform through which as many people as possible can exercise “the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community and to enjoy the arts” (Article 27, The Universal Declaration of Human Rights).

Our role extends to support for the rights of free speech; the rights to freely receive and impart information; and, in these days of algorithms curating and pushing us to mainstream commercial content, we offer protection to freedom of thought by ceding as much editorial control as current broadcast regulations allow to our contributors.

Resonance EXTRA is the UK’s only 24/7 digital broadcasting platform dedicated to sound art, radio art and experimental musics. Based in London, it broadcasts online via its website, TuneIn and Radioplayer and on DAB+ Digital Radio to a footprint of 4 million people in Brighton & Hove, Cambridge, Greater London and Norwich.

We invite audio artists to engage with our platform and listener-base directly, by responding to one of our frequent Open Calls for Broadcasts. We want to work with artists who seek to challenge conventional uses of the radio medium or who will use it to uncover global musical or artistic scenes that are currently under-represented.
