The Independent Community Radio Network (ICRN) is a non-profit organisation and web radio network founded in 2022. We connect and support radios from across Europe to foster sustainability, cross-regional collaboration, and knowledge-sharing in independent radio and community media. While our roots are in the Baltic-Nordic region, our network has expanded internationally, reflecting the growing need for cooperation in our field.

Our activities include network meetings, capacity-building workshops, and the creation of research and resources focused on web radio and the local communities of our members. We actively support underrepresented voices, ensuring our work reflects the diverse social groups our members serve. Through public knowledge-sharing, we aim to break competitiveness in community media and create an environment for cross-influencing. We approach our work creatively, and see this as an essential part of working together.

ICRN extends beyond digital platforms, with key collaborations at European Media Lab, Le Guess Who? Festival, NARA, and Reset Network. Our current activities are supported by Nordic Culture Point, and we are governed by a democratically elected board, with annual re-elections for transparency. Our operations are maintained by a legal representative and freelancers, and while our operating language is English, we embrace the linguistic and cultural diversity of our members.

ICRN became a legal entity registered in Lithuania in 2024.
