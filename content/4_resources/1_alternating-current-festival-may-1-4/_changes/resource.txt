We’re happy to announce that Alternating Current, organised by Dublin Digital Radio, kicks off this weekend!

Alternating Currents (2025) will take place from May 1 – 4 across various locations in Dublin, primarily at Flux Gallery Space, Flux Workshop Space, and Flux Courtyard. Presenting a diverse programme of audiovisual installations, sonic performances, workshops, and critical discussions, it will bring together artists, researchers, and grassroots radio practitioners to explore the intersections of sound, space, and community activism.

Exhibition-based projects like Flickering by Cian McCarthy offer immersive AV experiences throughout the weekend. Workshops and listening sessions at Flux Workshop Space invite collective reflection and sonic experimentation. Outdoor performances, such as Sonotecture Memos by Tadhg Kinsella at Flux Courtyard, activate public spaces through live sound interventions. The festival also includes thematic sessions such as Reclaiming Spaces Through Sounds & Radio, focusing on urban sound activism.

On Saturday, ICRN representatives will host a session at the Flux Workshop Space from 17:00 CET. Led by Samantha Lippett, Michael Holland, and Seán Finnan, What does it mean to be part of a grassroots radio network? will bring together shared experiences of running a grassroots radio network. These reflections will be accompanied by sound bites from the ICRN archives (2022-) and participants are invited to share their own vision for future cross-border collaborations. Michael Holland will also host a live broadcast on Dublin Digital Radio from 14:00 CET, together with the local music label Department of Energy.

Across all formats, Alternating Current fosters collaboration, DIY approaches, and critical engagement with independent cultural production. Through sound, the festival reimagines how spaces and communities can be collectively reclaimed and reshaped.
